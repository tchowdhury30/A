Compile-time errors indicate that there is something wrong with the syntax of the program. Example: omitting the semicolon at the end of a statement.

Run-time errors are produced if something goes wrong while the program is running. Example: an infinite recursion eventually causes a StackOverflowError.

Logic errors cause the program to do the wrong thing. Example: an expression may not be evaluated in the order you expect.

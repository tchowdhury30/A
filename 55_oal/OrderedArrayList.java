/*
 DISCO:
 - O(1) for the add method would be increased if the array length/ data was increased (or doubled)
 - Constants usually means the array does not have to shift elements or make many comparisons, and the task being accomplished can be done by plopping the element into its place.

 QCC:
 - Which sort methods does java have?
 - If two sorting methods have the same worst and best cases for time complexities, does it mean they are in one family of methods?
 - Can you use sorting methods with strings?
